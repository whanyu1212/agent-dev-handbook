# Evaluation-Driven Development Handbook

This repository serves as a practical guide to Evaluation-Driven Development (EDD) methodologies for agentic systems. It provides educational implementations and examples demonstrating how to systematically evaluate and improve AI agent performance. The codebase primarily leverages LangGraph and Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) frameworks to illustrate key EDD concepts and techniques.
